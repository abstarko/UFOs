# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to allow users to filter for UFO sightings with multiple criteria at the same time. Users will be able to filter the sightings by date, city, state, country and shape. This is done by modifying the javascript code from the module. 

## Results
The original code that I wrote in the module only filtered the data by date and would filter by clicking a button. The project called for a more extensive way to filter through the data, whether wanting to look up sightings just by a city or by using multiple filters to find a certain sighting. The finaized filter section is below (as you can see I chose just to filter by the State of TX):

## Summary 
I would like to be able to make the filter table more neat and user friendly. I would like for it to be in its own box and not across the whole webpage. I would like for the data to be easier to navigate through as well. I also feel as if sizing is slighty off on the webpage; text could be smaller in certain areas with a nice font, more color dimensions could be added and a more sleek / neat webpage would be nice.
